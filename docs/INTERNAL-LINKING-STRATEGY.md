## Key Pages Needing More Internal Links

### 1. Dashboard (High Priority)
- **Current Status**: Entry point but lacks contextual links
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Link to specific site details from recent activity
  - Link to project creation from empty states
  - Link to analytics from KPI cards
  - Link to settings from user preferences

### 2. Sites Page (High Priority)
- **Current Status**: Good filtering but limited navigation
- **Recommendations**:
  - Link to project details from site cards
  - Link to analytics filtered by site
  - Link to vendor configurations
  - Link to related use cases

### 3. Projects Page (Medium Priority)
- **Current Status**: Basic project listing
- **Recommendations**:
  - Link to associated sites
  - Link to project templates
  - Link to team member profiles
  - Link to related analytics

### 4. Analytics Page (Medium Priority)
- **Current Status**: Good visualizations but isolated
- **Recommendations**:
  - Link to specific sites/projects from charts
  - Link to detailed reports
  - Link to export functionality
  - Link to related settings

## Anchor Text Variations

### Navigation Links
- Primary: "View Sites", "Manage Projects", "Analytics Dashboard"
- Secondary: "Site Management", "Project Overview", "Performance Metrics"
- Contextual: "See all sites", "View project details", "Analyze performance"

### Content Links
- Descriptive: "deployment status for Site ABC", "project timeline for XYZ"
- Action-oriented: "Create new site", "Generate report", "Configure settings"
- Branded: "Portnox deployment guide", "NAC implementation checklist"

### Related Content
- "Related sites in this region"
- "Similar projects in your organization"
- "Recommended use cases for this deployment"
- "Vendor configurations for this setup"

## Best Practices Implementation

### Link Attributes
- Use `rel="noopener"` for external links
- Use `aria-label` for accessibility
- Use `title` sparingly for additional context
- Implement proper focus management

### URL Structure Best Practices
- Use kebab-case for consistency
- Include meaningful slugs
- Implement proper hierarchy
- Use query parameters for filters
